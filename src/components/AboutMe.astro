      Hi, I'm Joshua, a front-end software developer from Italy.
      <br />
       My primary tools of choice includes:
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>VueJS</li>
        <li>Laravel</li>
        <li>Inertia</li>
        <li>TailwindCSS</li>
        <li>MySQL</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      Beyond coding, I enjoy long walks along the Scottish Coast and spending time with friends. I'm interested in coffee and enjoy brewing up a nice latt√® or two now and then.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      While I have some preferred tools, I always choose the best one for the
      job, even if it's not on my usual list. My goal is to find the right
      solution for each project that I undertake.
